# ASPAM
Installation for animal spontaneous activity monitoring

The project include three main part:
* the rat box with the wheel (main ASPAM unit)
* the ADC for N channels
* the web-interface controlling logging 

All these part develops independently and, thus, are decorated as submodules.

# Submodules (parts of the project)

* **TCC** - the electronic circuit of the Turn Counter Controller (TCC) board

* **wheelbox** - mechanical drawings for manufacturing rat box and the wheel.  
We have a nice [video of this setup on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OO7PnywRuvI).

# Submodules (independent projects)

* **TCC_firmware** - firmware for SMT32 mounted to the TCC board

* **webinterface** - WSGI web interface for plotting rat running data
